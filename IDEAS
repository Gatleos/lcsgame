Bugs:

* heat does not feel threatening
* recruiting crashes when your squad consisting of the same professions you recruit dies during recruitment

QOI interface changes:

* add tab with easy equipment access to everyone + tabs of equipment categories
* TAB - toggles information shown in any list - from proffesion to presuasion/seduction/psychology + Charisma + slots of recruitments/meetings and lovers/dates, stealth/disguise/security/street sense + Agility
2 best combat skills + dodges stat on which the best one bases (Heart/Agility/Strength), 
	Easier sorting by pressing column's numbers - same as reorder squad first, second... etc
	DO NOT AUTO RESORT PEOPLE, keep X sorting even after changing tabs /\ resort when changing sort preferentions + auto show the best results (1st page)
	+ filters for for example only healthy ppl
* to your own custom views showing
* make arrows work in menus to choose selections/select with /\\/ and <>
* make possible changing squads' order

Other QoI changes:

* martial arts - - > physical disarm and impairment
* all information about events stackable on 1 screen and scrolls as they go + saves for one day
	to review if missed/forgot something + button to fill whole page with info instead of holding enter
* add meeting tab to review meetings with ppl with all needed information:
	expandable recruit's profiles, people's skills that can be learned from these meetings,	description of agents:
	how many slots/lovers they have, how much persuasion/seduction/psychology/charisma they have
plus meeting policy for less micro management:
	for example: meet for free until learned X skill,
	meet for free till ready to join,
	meet X times with X policy (and then decide) - mainly for training persuasion,
	auto accept joining LCS when ready on X position (sleeper/active agent),
	break at next meeting,
Also make this policy settable during meetings.


* show effects of wearing armor - generally more feedback about effects of equipment - even description in words
* more friendly sleeper agents display, let know of actions' ACTUAL efficiency and their detailed profiles, especially juice they earned via their LIBERAL ACTIONS
* add some actions like - sending someone somewhere (personally - to shop or any utility district), moving to base, renaming, ordering job for ANY people reviewing window (except raid :P)

Features/Ideas:

* research & science: develop and produce interrogating substances or fight resources (liberal gas!)
* add throwing weapons like grenades

* map? ! with districts and ascii drawn locations
* make possible to willingly go to the court for (much sooner trial) to clear yourself from any crimes
* make public more picky about your crime actions (in supporting liberals) and general support % in getting sonds view
* high psychology (5+ ) - gives you chance to sense negative intentions during meetings, or exact engagement and chance to decline on X option,
** add more options at conversation to recruit, and personalise choices and wills, for example choice of subjects to talk discuss with - psychology lets you know which topics are the most preferable
* new tab to manage people's policy - default tasks that one is assigned to on some circumstances: feeling well (default: laying low), wounded (def: laying low)
* street sense -> makes finding wanted cars and ppl to recruit easier

LARGE PROJECT IDEAS:

* create large, long term projects to participate in, actions avialible after preparations:
	for these tasks are already pre-prepared lists of steps/needs to fullfill. These actions may have both great benefits at success and painful penalties for failure
	You also get lots of juice after trying to realise prepared project.
	Some propositions (less or more developped):
	- make possible for with computer skills developping LIBERAL GAMES to sell them and decrease Wisdom (efficiency depends on creator's computers and psychology or science) - depending on the law
		it may be illegal and Conservatists may censor it (and probably will do if it becomes popular and it's effective), delegalise and shut down - which cuts most of your profits if you want to sell it,
		but still provides you with Extra de-Wisdoming as you wish :p
	* list of steps: well... programmers, psychologists + time and funds to release project; optional: good artists, musics and writers could improve quality of the game
	- planning a bank robbery (list of steps - like hostaging/enlightening bank manager/any bank socket), getting a man with high security, a man with high computers, a squad with guns and armors
	* list of steps: gathering the above + time for getting bank's details, map; optional: parallel actions to disrupt police and postpone it's reaction (sleeper agents also may participate),
		costumes to lower the chance of getting crime for it
	- bureocracy + some swindling to decrease X base's heat
	- project to erect new base/bunker
	- become/abolish president? :D
	- fiddle with election's results
	* possitive effect: more liberals in parliament; negative effect (very severe): alienating people to LCS and getting more conservative views
	- plan a prison outbreak (for both your agents and new recruits at prison) - via frontal attack or sneaky inflirtration/
	- nuclear plant meltdown - produce mutants?
	- build your own military facility to train shooting and fighting (uses ammunition to train) and teach these skills more effectively and create your own army!
	- project to clear member's name from crimes in court via corruption, sleepers, lawyers, etc.
	- create your own radiostation to manage with anchormen, musicians etc?
	- steal tanks from army :D
	- create your own LIBERAL TEXTILE FACTORY to sell goods
	- work onto LIBERAL DICTATURE AND ALL HAIL THE GLORIOUS LEADER!
	- prepare anti-president campaign
	- build a secret tunnel network between your bases to escape sieges and make all bases become 'one'
Some of these are actually possible, but putting them here will help in letting know about this possibility and it will make easier to organise and prepare for the event

* add morale (their stability - buffor - would depend on one's heart)? those could benefit all actions and learning pace (if high) and reverse if low, or even lead to betrayal (if heart-wisdom low and morale are close to 0)
	morale could increase by:
		random events, successes of people in LCS one knows/recruited, media (telling about successes of liberalism), liberal election, high living standards, liberal results of voting, 
	morale could decrease by:
		any negative of the above + especially wounds and being crippled, being imprisoned, interrogating or murdering (if these occur may depend on heart)
		low juice
		laying low
	These influence both instantly the value of morale and the pace of morale going up/down per day - to prevent instant ragequits of your members after failures
	As you may have noticed, I listed more negative factors than possitive: that's because of:
	To increase general morales one could also assign psychologists (similarily to teaching)
	SUBIDEA: - add some costs and extra management connected with that: pay for delivering food (choose quality), entertainment and living standards to get higher morales

* maybe add some random events for bases and danger of recognition/events during travels to locations - danger of recognition depends on street sense (and trains it) +
	+ threat level for being recognized (laying low or other base-actions lower it, while commiting crimes increase it - also sleeper agents: policemen or ppl in police station/cable news anchormen
	or any TV/radio/news ppl help to make threat (with limited efficiency for each of media) level go up slower / they disrupt advertisement of the crimes
	sleeper policemen could also warn you aboutt patrols/raids on your base 
	Make any conservative encounters be able to recognise you and try to seize you if that's their job (sec guards, agents, policemen etc) - depends on stealth and disguise to mitigate or eliminate this effect
	
* increase infulence of religion and make possible to recruit via it and create liberal sect, possibly add church location

* make more useful more skills - like science - make possible to create your drug empire to raise funds - at Science 20 you become Heisenberg, 
	business - to improve selling prices, lower business , paying for rents, 
	art - paint to increase the impact of your press via LIBERAL PICTURES, not only graphitti, - make possible LITERALLY create graphitti at certain location during raid same as opening doors to have impact on THAT
		exact location
	psychology - as I suggested in many of these ideas
	street sense - as in threat level, also may serve as intuition in guessing encounters' weapons
	driving - umm it's difficult one...
	martial arts - as any other weapon has higher damage and efficiency - add possibility to try to disarm someone in fight or prevent escaping, increase seizure (kidnapping) odds
	throwing - err what this skill is doing here? it's not an rpg roguelike where you actually throw
	I suggest firearms for all kinds of shooting weapons, and heavy for heavy ones like basooka and flamethrower which you can use manually
	I suggest also one cathegory for swords, axes, knives and clubs and make them use more strength than agility
	religion - as suggested
This idea connects with idea about adding diversity to conversations - to discuss X subject

* add some more tactics to raid screen - make encounters fade longer and show possible encounters on next fields (which spawn and move, you sense them with street sense skill),
	more entrances to locations 
	if you have sleeper agents in the place, make possible to meet them/phone them and for example ask to evacuate you from the building at cost of their disguise and laying low

* add some dangers for sleepers
